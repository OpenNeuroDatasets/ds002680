  "Instructions": "Participants were tested on two alternated tasks: a categorization task and a recognition task. Participants were instructed to start each block by pressing a touch-sensitive button. A small fixation point appeared in the middle of the black screen, then a photograph was flashed for 20 ms. Subjects were instructed to give a go\/no-go response by releasing the button as quickly as possible when a target-image was presented and by keeping their finger(s) on the button for non-target images. Any response given after 1000 ms was considered a no-go response. In the animal categorization task, subjects were instructed to respond if an animal was present in the picture. In the target-image recognition task, a given animal was assigned as the target. During a learning phase, participants were instructed to carefully inspect and memorize the target-image to ensure a quick and precise response in the testing block that immediately followed. ",
